# Configs

This folder contains configs that needs to be preserved in the git, but we don't have an idea on yet how to do that. This folder shouldn't be merged to main as it is, these files should be committed to our micropython fork.

Files:

-
- `sdkconfig` is a config for our ESP32 build, cpoy this file to `micropython/ports/esp32/build-ESP32_GENERIC_S3-DEVKITW2/sdkconfig` when starting to work on this branch
